# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.*

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
    
  -Joanna: Learning to pair program in harmony. Follow TDD process as much as we can. To pass & understand the REPL.
  -Sid: I want to be able to effectively pair program & also understand each line of code well. To learn how to not only code efficiently but to understand the process in order to pass.
  
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
  -Joanna: Open collaboration. We have to do pair programming for this assignment.
  -Sid: Open collaboration. We have to do pair programming for this assignment.
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
  -Joanna: prefer Slack/Zoom. Can handle direct, brutal honesty.
  -Sid: prefer Slack/Zoom. Direct communication
* How would you describe your work style?
  -Joanna: Work hard for periods of time, with pom breaks.
  -Sid: Work hard for periods of time, with pom breaks.
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
  -Joanna: Communication, flexible. Also, open.
  -Sid: Adaptable & dependable. I'm open to most things.
* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
  -Joanna: Code got ahead of tests. 
  -Sid: I got ahead of myself in terms of trying to figure out what the code should be doing in later classes instead of focusing on current class.
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
  -Joanna: To start, scoping out big picture, then identify chunks we want to tackle. Checking in later in the week to decide if we like the direction.
  -Sid: Planning out what we want to do with our code first. Then, begin pseudocoding & make frequent commits.
* How will we overcome obstacles?
  -Joanna: Ask for help as needed.
  -Sid: Ask every coding human for help with our problems.
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
  -Joanna: Allow me the time to think through concepts. 
  -Sid: Allow me the time to think through concepts. Enough sleep & fuel to keep going.
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
  -Joanna: Won't be as available on Easter Sunday. 5-6 only conflict. Can work evenings or mornings.
  -Sid: 4-6 conflict (food & exercise). Can work evenings & occasional mornings.
  -Schedule Start: 6-8 pm 
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
  -Joanna: Kind feedback. Maybe too kind sometimes.
  -Sid: Read the room first, then phrase my feedback appropriately. It may not always be best to be as direct as you sometimes want to be.
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
 -Joanna: Technical strength: can look at code big picture, & find errors i.e. missing commas, indentation, etc. Sometimes hit a wall in moments when I need to be thinking dynamically. Push me to explore & figure it out while still providing support.
 -Sid: Technical strength: organized code. Understanding scope better & concepts. It will come with practice. Analogies to help me better understand what my code is trying to do.
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
  -Joanna: Git flow w/pull requests
  -Sid: Git flow w/pull requests
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
  -Joanna: Talk it out first. Seek help.  
  -Sid: Talk it out first. Seek help.  
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
  -Joanna: We'll know it's successful if the program runs/ we can play the game. We feel good about how we wrote the tests & the tests are passing, and we've allowed time to refactor. 
  -Sid: We'll know it's successful if the program runs/ we can play the game. We understand exactly what our code is doing & can explain it to others. Will try to refactor this time.
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
  -Joanna: Celebratory music/dance. Verbalize praise. HH code session
  -Sid: Celebratory music/dance. Verbalize praise. HH code session
Any additional questions that you would like to add:
  -Joanna: N/A
  -Sid: N/A
  
### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
  -Joanna: 
  -Sid: Music & silence.
* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?
 -Joanna: Not taking the time to have breaks & eat meals at regular times. Meal prep & take breaks. Family boundaries.
 -Sid: Not taking the time to have breaks & eat meals at regular times. Meal prep & take breaks.
* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.
 -Joanna: Message on Slack
 -Sid: Message on Slack
* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
 -Joanna: Every 30 min of work, take a 5 min Pom break. If we're slow moving. If in the zone, we can do longer work/pom breaks.
 -Sid: Take a break after finishing a chunks of code. Go with the flow. Talk it out.
* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
 -Joanna: Read each other. Will tell other person what's going on. 
 -Sid: Talk it out. 

### Template for DTR Memo

Project: Battleship

Group Member Names: Joanna Cortes, Sidarth Bagawandoss

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
-Joanna: Learning to pair program in harmony. Follow TDD process as much as we can. To pass & understand the REPL. Both of us pass & having it be a pleasant process. We'll know it's successful if the program runs/ we can play the game. We feel good about how we wrote the tests & the tests are passing, and we've allowed time to refactor. 
  -Sid: I want to be able to effectively pair program & also understand each line of code well. To learn how to not only code efficiently but to understand the process in order to pass. We both pass & have fun coding whilst struggling.We'll know it's successful if the program runs/ we can play the game. We understand exactly what our code is doing & can explain it to others. Will try to refactor this time.
